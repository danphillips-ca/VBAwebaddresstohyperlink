# An MS Word Macro for webaddresstohyperlink

An MS Word Macro to identify web addresses in a Word document and turn them into hyperlinks.

Requested by a colleague who uses EndNote with MS Word. Note that it will ignore any web addresses that are already hyperlinked to elsewhere in the document. It is set to loop for 400 links.

The initial version was debugged extensively using an AI because I'm new a this. Check it carefully and please make pull requests if you can improve upon it.
